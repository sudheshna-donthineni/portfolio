Since 18, I dabbled in different fields of Computer Science; back-end, front-end, analytics. It was after a long process of late-night coffees and Stack Overflow dreams, I realized full-stack web development calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving, and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of course). <br/><br/>Am I good at it? Let's talk and then you decide! Do I love it? Yes, but let's still talk!

In my spare time, I manage a voluntary organization called Code Club, which aims to help young people get involved in technology. This involves educating, training, and raising awareness for low-income children to get involved in coding and programming.
